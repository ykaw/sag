INTRODUCTION

SAG (System Activity Grapher) is a light weight system monitor
consisting of sh, awk and perl scripts.

This runs on OpenBSD operating system (for version 5.5 and later),
and easy to port to other unix-like systems.


INSTALL PROCEDURE

0. Ensure (or newly make) a SAG's user/group account.
   For security reasons, we don't recommend running SAG as a superuser (root).

1. Extract and locate the SAG package to an appropriate directory.
   This directory will be set to an environment variable called 'SAGHOME' .
   Ordinary, SAGHOME is recommended to be equivalent to the account's HOME.

2. Make symlinks reffering to gnuplot (and netpbm's executables, if needed),
   under $SAGHOME/bin .

3. On $SAGHOME/conf/examples, reconfigure crontabs of root and the SAG acount.
   Copy dfplot.gp, netcmd.sh, postgproc.sh and shconf.sh to $SAGHOME/conf ,
   then edit those copied files to reconfigure parameters.
   Add $SAGHOME/conf/examples/rc.local to /etc/rc.local .

4. Copy all files except CVS from $SAGHOME/plot/examples to $SAGHOME/plot .
   Edit $SAGHOME/plot/common , to choose file format of generated graphs.

5. Activate SAG's crontab entry.
